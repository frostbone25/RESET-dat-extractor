# RESET Dat Extractor
This is a command line application for extracting files for the unreleased indie game [RESET](http://reset-game.net/). This application is designed for greenlight demo that was released in September 22 2015, although since was taken down *(there is still a [download link](http://www.mediafire.com/file/ebx4y2ixaeopnxp/Reset_Greenlight_Demo_0.4.exe/file
MediaFire) for the demo. If it's down let me know and I can put up a new one.)*
