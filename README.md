# RESET Dat Extractor
This is a command line application for extracting files from .dat archives for the unreleased indie game [RESET](https://web.archive.org/web/20220319222636/http://reset-game.net/). This application is designed for the greenlight demo that was released in September 22 2015, although since the build was taken down *(there is still a [download link](http://www.mediafire.com/file/ebx4y2ixaeopnxp/Reset_Greenlight_Demo_0.4.exe/file) for the demo. If it's down let me know and I can put up a new one.)*

### Usage

`app.exe [inputDirectory]`

Searches the directory for .dat files and automatically extracts all of them. Creating a folder matching the name of the extracted dat file and extracting the files in the data archive in that folder on the disk.
